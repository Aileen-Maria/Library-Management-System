# Library-Management-System
The Library Management System is a SQL project that manages library data, including branches, employees, books, customers, and transactions. It tracks book availability, employee details, and customer activity, with queries to retrieve relevant insights for efficient management.

## Project Description

The Library Management System includes multiple tables such as:

- **Branch**: Stores information about library branches.
- **Employee**: Contains details of employees working in the library.
- **Books**: Holds the information about books available in the library.
- **Customer**: Stores data about library customers.
- **IssueStatus**: Tracks the status of issued books to customers.
- **ReturnStatus**: Tracks the return status of books.

The project focuses on retrieving relevant data based on different queries like available books, employee salaries, issued books, customer details, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Database**: MySQL
- **SQL**: For writing queries to interact with the database.
